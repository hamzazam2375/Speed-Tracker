# Speed Tracker

Speed Tracker is a simple mobile app that uses the phone camera and a Python backend to estimate motion speed from camera frames.

## What it does

- Opens the camera in the app
- Captures frames at a fixed interval
- Sends each frame to the backend
- Tracks motion between frames and estimates speed in km/h
- Shows the live speed and a short session summary

## How to run

### 1. Start the backend

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

The backend runs on port `8000`.

### 2. Start the app

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Use Expo Go, Android, or iOS to open the app.

### 3. Check the backend address

If your device cannot reach the backend, update the IP address in `src/services/api.js`.

## Main CV concepts used

- Frame capture: the app takes camera snapshots instead of streaming full video. See `src/hooks/useCamera.js` and `src/screens/CameraScreen.js`.
- Image encoding and decoding: frames are sent as base64 and decoded on the backend. See `src/services/api.js` and `backend/app.py`.
- Resizing: frames are resized before analysis to keep processing lighter. See `backend/app.py`.
- Grayscale conversion: frames are converted to grayscale before motion tracking. See `backend/app.py`.
- Noise reduction: Gaussian blur is used to reduce noise. See `backend/app.py`.
- Feature detection: Shi-Tomasi corners are detected with `goodFeaturesToTrack`. See `backend/app.py`.
- Optical flow tracking: Lucas-Kanade optical flow tracks feature movement between frames. See `backend/app.py`.
- Motion estimation: point displacement is measured and turned into speed. See `backend/app.py`.
- Smoothing and filtering: weighted averaging, spike rejection, and dead-zone logic keep the speed stable. See `backend/app.py`.
